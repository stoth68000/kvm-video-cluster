On master, deploy the dashboard application.

# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta4/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml

Obtain a Bearer Token, which can be used to login:
Now we need to find token we can use to log in. Execute following command:

kvm-video-cluster/dashboard/create-dashboard-admin-user.sh

The admin-user will be created and given an access token, displayed on the screen. Use this to sign-in
to the dashboard application below.

On the master, start the web proxy (use screen to background it):
# kubectl proxy
Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001

Don't try to use the promiscious modes in proxy. While you'll see a login page
for the dashboard, when you click 'signon' nothing will happen.

vvvvv DON'T USE THIS
# kubectl proxy --address 0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts '.*'

Now we need to access the dashboard from outside of 192.168.2.162
Setup a ssh tunnel to access it, on your mac:
ssh -L 38001:127.0.0.1:8001 root@192.168.2.162

Dashboard is now be available via this url:
http://127.0.0.1:38001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/login

Login using the token we queried above, during user creation.
