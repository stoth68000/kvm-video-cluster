Create a virtual system and nominate it the private docker
registery server for the entire network. We'll clone the base image, install
some dependencies.

The system will have the following details, IP and two host names:
192.168.2.168 vc168 dockersrv docker-registry.example.com docker-registry

You'll see this reflected in host files all over the cluster.

From the scripts dir, on 192.168.2.161, create a new virtual machine
configuration.

# cd scripts
cat <<EOF >vc168.cfg
NEW_HOSTNAME=vc168
NEW_IPADDR=192.168.2.168
EOF

Create the new virtual machine from that new configuration.
# ./clone-base-vm.sh vc168.cfg

Start the new virtual machine
# sudo virsh start vc168

ssh into the dockersrv, install any dep scripts, then run them
to configure the base image as a nfs server.

vc161 # scp scripts/storagesrv-mount.sh root@192.168.2.168:~
vc161 # scp scripts/dockersrv-secure-install.sh root@192.168.2.168:~

vc168# cd ~
vc168# ./vm-install.sh
vc168# ./storagesrv-mount.sh
vc168# ./dockersrv-secure-install.sh

End.
