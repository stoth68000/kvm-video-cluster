Each kubernetes master and worker, and possible any other relevant systems, they need
to be able to obtain private docker images from our own docker registry.

On each system, vc162 through vc166 (and any others you choose), run the script to
configure the local docker instances and install the private cert.

See docker-registry-install.sh
